# Multiple Choice Code Quiz with Highscores

## Description

This application features a welcome screen that asks the user to begin the quiz. When the user clicks "Start Quiz" the timer begins (75 seconds) and the first question appears on the screen. When the user selects their answer, it is validated and "right" or "wrong" appears on the screen. This continues until all the questions are answered. If the user gets a question wrong, 15 seconds are deducted from their time. The game is over either when the time runs out (gets to 0) or when the user finishes answering their question -- whatever comes first.

When the game is over, a new section will appear on the page that asks the user to enter their initials and submit their score. The users score is the time remaining on the timer. When the user clicks submit, they are taken to the Highscore page where a list of highscores are displayed from largest to smallest. From here the user may clear the highscores, or they may begin the quiz again.
